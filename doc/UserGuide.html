<h2>Introduction</h2>
    		   
<p> 			IeUnit is a framework to test logical behaviors of web pages. It helps 
 users to  			create, organize and execute functional unit tests.</p>
    		   
<p>The architecture of IeUnit is based on the <a
 href="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm"> 				xUnit</a> framework 
 which has been adapted to various languages and  			platforms. IeUnit is 
implemented in JavaScript language and tailored to Windows  			platform. By
leveraging services provided by Internet Explorer, its DHTML model  			and 
related COM technologies IeUnit offers a simple and efficient test  			framework. 
 		</p>
    		   
<p> 			The main characteristics of IeUnit are: 		</p>
    		   
<ul>
    			<li> 			It is easy to understand and to use for users familiar with
 Internet Explorer  			and its DHTML model. 			</li>
     <li> 			It is extensible in an objected oriented manner. 			</li>
     <li> 			It can work in a non-intrusive manner: You can test HTML pages 
 without changing  			the page's source code. 			</li>
     <li> 				All software components required by IeUnit are freely available 
 on Windows XP  				platform. 			</li>
    		   
</ul>
    		   
<p> 			As representative examples consider the following use cases for IeUnit:
  		</p>
    		   
<ul>
    			<li> 			You have developed a web page that allows user to logon with
user  name and password.  			You want to test that this page accepts user
with valid password and rejects  			user with invalid password. 			</li>
     <li> 			You want to test that the response time for you web site for 
typical   			transactions are below 10 seconds. 			</li>
     <li> 				Smart bookmark: Some web portal offers service via stateful 
sessions.  To use  				those services you normally have to manually logon
to the site, then navigate  to particular  				page. Using the IeUnit you
can create a short script that  reduces the whole  				navigation work to
a single mouse click. 			</li>
    		   
</ul>
    		   
<p>It should be noted that although IeUnit only works on Windows platform 
 it can be  			used to test HTML pages coming from any web servers as long 
 as those pages are  			coded according to HTML standard.</p>
    		   
<p> 			As mentioned above IeUnit is intended to test the logical behavior 
 of web  			pages. It is not intended to test artistic aspects of web pages. 
 Also, IeUnit  			currently doesn't support testing of features implemented 
 with browser plug-ins  			(like Acrobat Reader, Shockwave etc.).</p>
