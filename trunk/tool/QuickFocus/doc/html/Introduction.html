<h1 class="Topic">Introduction</h1>
             
<p>With the growing popularity of Internet web based applications have become
a popular way to deliver information and services. Many tools have been developed
to facilitate the test of web based applications. Among them the open source
test framework <a href="http://ieunit.sourceforge.net">IeUnit</a>&nbsp; provides
a very simple yet efficient solution. With IeUnit users can write short scripts
to control Internet Explorer to performed testing tasks.<br>
 <br>
However, IeUnit has the main difficulty that it not only requires       
      good knowledge about the&nbsp;DHTML model, but&nbsp; also good knowledge
             about the DOM structure of the page under test. The latter can
often only be obtained              by examining  the page's HTML source.
For large complex web pages direct  examination without specially designed
tools quickly become a tedious and error prone task.</p>
   
<p>QuickFocus is an application designed to help user overcome these  difficulties.
In particular,              QuickFocus offers the following services:</p>
             
<ul>
               <li>                 Enable users to inspect HTML page by&nbsp;clicking
directly on the rendered HTML page.</li>
               <li>                 Suggest test code snippets to validate
or control selected elements.</li>
               <li>                 Execute test&nbsp;code snippets.</li>
               <li>                 Generate simple templates for IeUnit
test  cases&nbsp;and IeUnit smart bookmarks.</li>
   
</ul>
             
<p>With these features QuickFocus not only helps experienced programmer to
 develop              testing scripts, but also novice  users to quickly
learn              IeUnit framework and accomplish browser automation tasks.<br>
