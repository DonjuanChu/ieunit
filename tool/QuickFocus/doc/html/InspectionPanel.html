        <h1 class="Topic">The inspection panel</h1>
        The inspection panel provides user interface to generate, edit and execute 
        IeUnit scripts. The inspection panel has the following components:<br>
        <p><b>The code snippet window</b></p>
        <p>QuickFocus issues code snippet into this window. You can execute the code in 
            this window by clicking on the "Run Snippet" button in the inspection panel. 
            You can execute part of the code by marking part of the code snippet then 
            clicking on the "Run Snippet" button. When you manually changed the content in 
            this window you can undo the changes by pressing the Ctrl-Z key. This code 
            snippet window has a&nbsp;context menu that allows quick editing and execution 
            of selected code snippet.
        </p>
        <p><b>Assertion checkbox<br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>If this checkbox is checked QuickFocus will generate assertion based validating 
            code snippet when ever an element in the page window gets selected.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Action checkbox<br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>If this checkbox is checked QuickFocus will generate action code snippet (e.g. <tt>this.clickButton()</tt>) 
            for the selected element when ever an element in the page window gets selected.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Alternative checkbox<br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>When this checkbox is checked QuickFocus will generate alternative suggestions 
            to validate or control the selected element.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>SBK Submit button</b><br>
        </p>
        <p>Generate smart bookmark code snippet using the currently selected element&nbsp; 
            (which is normally a button element)&nbsp;as submit button. QuickFocus will 
            generate a statement for each input element on the page. You usually have to 
            adjust input values for the input elements directly in the snippet window. 
            If&nbsp; no element has been selected currently this task will only generate 
            no-submitting statements (e.g. no clickButton statements). You can then click 
            on a submit button to let QuickFocus to&nbsp;complete the SBK submit script.
        </p>
        <p><b>Submit button<br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>Generate submit code snippet. This button works similar as the SBK submit button 
            except that this button doesn't issue the first <tt>this.openWindow()</tt>statement. 
            When executing the code snippet via the "Run Snippet" button QuickFocus won't 
            open a new Internet Explorer window, but execute the code directly against the 
            page currently loaded in the page window.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Test case button<br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>Generate an IeUnit test case template for the currently loaded URL. You usually 
            need to insert more statements into the code snippet to perform real testing 
            tasks. You can use the "Submit" button to insert testing code into the 
            template.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Run Snippet button<br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>Execute the code snippet in the snippet window. If you have marked some code 
            segment in the snippet window QuickFoucs will only execute the marked code. 
            Most code snippets start with a <tt>this.openWindow() </tt>statement, so that 
            an new Internet Explorer window will be opened when executing those code 
            snippet. If the code or the marked code doesn't contain a <tt>this.openWindow() </tt>
            statement QuickFocus will insert a <tt>this.seekAndSetWindow() </tt>statement<tt>, </tt>
            so that the code will be executed against the page currently loaded into the 
            page window.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>The test result will be&nbsp;reported&nbsp;through status line or 
            separate&nbsp;message window.</p>
        <p><b>Clear Snippet button<br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>Clear the code in the snippet window.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Snippet dragging handle</b><br>
        </p>
        <p>You can generate a copy of the code snippet currently display in the snippet 
            window by dragging this handle to the desktop. If the code snippet contains a 
            JavaScript function definition line (as required by IeUnit test case format) a 
            file with the extension <tt>".jst"</tt> will be generated. Otherwise, 
            QuickFocus will generate smart bookmark file with the extension <tt>".sbk".<br>
            </tt>
        </p>
        <p><br>
